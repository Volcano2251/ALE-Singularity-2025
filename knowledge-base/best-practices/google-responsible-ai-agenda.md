# A Shared Agenda for Responsible AI Progress

**Source:** https://blog.google/technology/ai/a-shared-agenda-for-responsible-ai-progress/

## Executive Summary
This document outlines Google's strategic framework for the responsible development and regulation of Artificial Intelligence. It advocates for a "shared agenda" involving collaboration between industry, academia, and government. The core philosophy promotes a **proportionate, risk-based regulatory approach** that balances innovation with safety, leveraging existing legal frameworks where possible rather than creating redundant rules.

## Key Takeaways

### Core Policy Recommendations
1.  **Leverage Existing Regulations:**
    *   Before creating new laws, regulators should apply existing frameworks (privacy, safety, non-discrimination) to AI contexts.
    *   New rules should only be created for truly novel challenges specific to AI.

2.  **Proportionate, Risk-Based Approach:**
    *   Regulation should not be "one-size-fits-all."
    *   It should focus on *applications* and specific risks.
    *   Accountability should be distributed appropriately among developers, deployers, and users based on their role and control.

3.  **Interoperable Standards:**
    *   AI development is global; therefore, governance standards must be internationally interoperable to prevent fragmentation.
    *   Alignment with bodies like ISO/IEC and the OECD is crucial.

4.  **Expectation Parity:**
    *   Evaluate AI systems against the same standards as non-AI systems.
    *   Recognize that even imperfect AI systems can offer improvements over existing manual or legacy processes.

5.  **Transparency & Accountability:**
    *   Transparency mechanisms (like documentation, model cards) are essential to build user trust and facilitate accountability.
    *   Mechanisms must be in place to allow rules to evolve alongside rapid technological progress.

### Strategic Pillars (Google AI Principles)
*   **Social Benefit:** AI must demonstrate clear benefits that outweigh potential risks.
*   **Risk Management:** Continuous impact assessment and safety integration throughout the development lifecycle.
*   **Constraint:** Deliberate non-deployment of technologies (e.g., specific facial recognition APIs) until safety and legal hurdles are cleared.
*   **Multi-disciplinary Collaboration:** Partnering with universities (e.g., Stanford, Berkeley, Oxford) and research institutes to establish robust standards.

### External References & Frameworks
The agenda explicitly references alignment with:
*   **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (USA)**
*   **OECD AI Principles**
*   **ISO/IEC Standards**
*   **EU AI Act** (as an evolving legislative landscape)

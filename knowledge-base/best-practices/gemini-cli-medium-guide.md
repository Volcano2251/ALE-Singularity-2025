## Executive Summary
This guide treats interactions with Gemini CLI not as simple chats, but as a disciplined software engineering process. It emphasizes structured preparation (PRDs), iterative development, and rigorous context management to maximize the tool's effectiveness for complex coding tasks.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. The "Software Engineering" Mindset
- **Start with a PRD**: Do not begin coding immediately. Create a `PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document) first. This aligns the agent's understanding with your goals.
- **Break It Down**: Decompose large features into small, testable units. Avoid "do everything at once" prompts.

### 2. Prompt Engineering for CLI
- **Be Explicit**: Ambiguity is the enemy. Specify file paths, variable names, and desired logic patterns clearly.
- **Context is King**: Feed relevant files into the context using `@filename`. Do not rely on the agent to "guess" the project structure.
- **Iterative Refinement**: If the output isn't perfect, refine the prompt and try again. Treat prompts like code that needs debugging.

### 3. Workflow Discipline
- **Commit Often**: Use Git to save progress frequently. If the agent hallucinates or breaks code, a recent commit allows for a safe rollback.
- **Test Continuously**: Run tests after every significant change generated by the CLI. Do not let errors accumulate.
- **Review Code**: Always review the code generated by the CLI before accepting it. You are the lead engineer; Gemini is the junior developer/assistant.

### 4. Tool Utilization
- Leverage the CLI's ability to read files and execute shell commands to automate repetitive parts of the workflow.

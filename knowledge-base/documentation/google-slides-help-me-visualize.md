# Help Me Visualize in Google Slides

**Source:** Derived from Google Workspace Support & various technical guides.

## Executive Summary
"Help me visualize" is a generative AI feature in Google Slides (part of Gemini for Google Workspace) that allows users to create custom images directly within their presentation. By entering a text prompt, users can generate photorealistic images, vector art, or sketches to illustrate their slides without leaving the application.

## Key Takeaways

### Prerequisites
*   **Account:** Requires a Google Workspace account with a Gemini add-on (e.g., Gemini Business, Gemini Enterprise) or participation in Google Workspace Labs.
*   **Settings:** Ensure "Smart features and personalization" are enabled in your Google Account settings.
*   **Access:** Available via the "Create image with Gemini" panel in the sidebar.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Accessing the Feature
1.  **Open** a Google Slides presentation.
2.  **Select** the slide where you want the image.
3.  **Launch:**
    *   Click **Insert** > **Image** > **Help me create an image**.
    *   OR click the **Help me create an image** (sparkle/star icon) in the toolbar.

#### 2. Generating an Image
1.  **Enter a Prompt:** In the panel on the right, type a detailed description of the image you want (e.g., *"A futuristic city skyline at sunset with flying cars"* or *"A watercolor painting of a coffee shop in Paris"*).
    *   *Tip:* Be specific about the subject, setting, lighting, and style for better results.
2.  **Select Style (Optional):** Click "Add a style" to choose a specific aesthetic:
    *   **Photography:** Realistic photos.
    *   **Vector Art:** Clean, scalable-style graphics.
    *   **Watercolor:** Artistic, painted look.
    *   **Sketch:** Hand-drawn style.
    *   **I'm Feeling Lucky:** Let the AI choose the best style for the prompt.
3.  **Select Aspect Ratio (Optional):** Choose from **Square**, **Wide**, or **Tall**.
4.  **Create:** Click the **Create** button.
5.  **Review:** Gemini will generate 4 variations.

#### 3. Inserting and Refining
1.  **Insert:** Click on any of the generated thumbnails to insert it into your slide.
2.  **Refine:**
    *   If the results aren't quite right, click **View more** to see new variations based on the same prompt.
    *   **Edit Prompt:** Modify your text description to add more detail or correct the AI's interpretation, then click **Create** again.
3.  **Edit Image:** Once inserted, the image functions like any other standard image in Slides (crop, resize, rotate, add border).

### Best Practices
*   **Detail is Key:** Instead of *"a dog,"* try *"a golden retriever puppy running through a field of sunflowers during the golden hour, photography style."*
*   **Iterate:** Use the feedback loop. If the style is wrong, explicitly select a different style filter rather than just describing it in text.
*   **Safety:** The tool has built-in safety filters and may refuse to generate images depicting specific named people, violence, or copyrighted characters.

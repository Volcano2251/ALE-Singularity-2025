**Source:** Derived from Google Workspace Support & various technical guides (original URL unavailable).

## Executive Summary
"Help me write" is a generative AI feature embedded in Google Docs (part of Gemini for Google Workspace). It assists users in drafting new content from scratch or rewriting existing text to change its tone, length, or format. It is designed to be an iterative writing partner, allowing for refinement and feedback before finalizing content.

## Key Takeaways

### Prerequisites
*   **Account:** Requires a Google Workspace account with a Gemini add-on (e.g., Gemini Business, Gemini Enterprise) or participation in Google Workspace Labs.
*   **Interface:** Accessed via the "Help me write" (pencil with sparkles) icon in the document margin.

### Core Features & Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Write New Text (Drafting)
Used for generating content from a blank page or a specific cursor location.
1.  **Open** a Google Doc.
2.  **Click** the "Help me write" (pencil) icon on the left margin (or in the center for a blank doc).
3.  **Enter a Prompt:** Type a clear instruction (e.g., *"Write a project proposal for a new marketing campaign targeting Gen Z"*).
    *   *Tip:* Use instructions/commands rather than questions for better results.
4.  **Click "Create".**
5.  **Refine (Optional):**
    *   **Feedback:** Rate the output ("Good suggestion" / "Bad suggestion").
    *   **Edit Prompt:** Click the prompt text at the top, modify it, and click "Update".
    *   **Refine Menu:** Use the "Refine" button to *Formalize*, *Shorten*, *Elaborate*, or *Retry*.
6.  **Insert:** Click "Insert" to add the text to your document.

#### 2. Rewrite Existing Text (Refining)
Used for modifying content you have already written.
1.  **Highlight** the text you want to change.
2.  **Click** the "Help me write" (pencil) icon that appears in the margin.
3.  **Select a Preset or Custom Action:**
    *   **Rephrase:** Rewords the text while keeping the meaning.
    *   **Shorten:** Condenses the text (good for summaries).
    *   **Elaborate:** Expands on points with more detail.
    *   **Tone Adjustment:** Choose *Formal* (for business) or *Casual* (for blogs/internal notes).
    *   **Format:** *Bulletize* turns paragraphs into lists.
    *   **Custom:** Type a specific instruction (e.g., *"Make this sound more exciting"*).
4.  **Apply:** Click "Replace" to overwrite the selection or "Insert" to add it below.

### Best Practices
*   **Iterate:** Rarely is the first draft perfect. Use the "Refine" tools or edit the prompt to guide the AI.
*   **Context:** The AI reads the surrounding text (if available) to match style, but explicit context in your prompt helps.
*   **Verification:** Always review generated text for accuracy, especially for factual claims.

## Key Takeaways

### The 4 Main Components of a Strong Prompt
To maximize effectiveness, a prompt should ideally contain these four elements:
1.  **Persona:** Who is the AI acting as? (e.g., "You are a product manager," "You are an empathetic customer service rep").
2.  **Task:** What exactly do you need done? (e.g., "Summarize this email," "Write a blog post," "Create a project plan").
3.  **Context:** Provide background information. (e.g., "The project is about sustainability," "The audience is executive leadership").
4.  **Format:** How should the output look? (e.g., "Bullet points," "A table with columns for X and Y," "A 500-word essay").

### Prompt Iteration Strategy
Success often requires a conversation, not just a one-off command.
*   **Refine:** If the first result isn't perfect, use follow-up prompts like "Make it shorter," "Change the tone to be more professional," or "Add a column for due dates."
*   **Break it down:** For complex tasks, split the prompt into smaller steps.

### Technical Requirements

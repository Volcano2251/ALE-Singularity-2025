## Executive Summary
**Gems** are custom versions of Gemini that act as specialized AI experts for specific topics or tasks. Think of them as persistent "personas" or "agents" that remember a specific set of instructions, style, and context, saving you from having to repeat the same prompt requirements every time you start a new chat. They are available to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Premade Gems
Google provides several pre-configured Gems to get started:
*   **Learning Coach:** Breaks down complex topics into understandable lessons.
*   **Brainstormer:** Generates creative ideas and expands on initial thoughts.
*   **Career Guide:** Offers professional advice, interview prep, and career planning.
*   **Coding Partner:** Assists with writing, debugging, and explaining code.
*   **Writing Editor:** Reviews text for grammar, flow, and tone.

### 2. How to Create a Custom Gem
1.  **Access:** Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com).
2.  **Navigate:** Click on **Gem manager** (or "Explore Gems") in the left sidebar.
3.  **Initiate:** Click **"New Gem"**.
4.  **Configure:**
    *   **Name:** Give your Gem a distinct name (e.g., "SQL Expert", "Marketing Copywriter").
    *   **Instructions:** Enter the core directives. (See "Best Practices" below).
    *   **Magic Wand:** Use the "magic wand" icon to let Gemini expand your basic one-sentence instruction into a comprehensive prompt.
5.  **Test:** Use the preview window on the right to chat with your Gem and verify its behavior.
6.  **Save:** Click **Create**.

### 3. How to Use & Edit Gems
*   **Usage:** Once created, your Gems appear in the left sidebar under "Gems". Click one to start a new chat with that specific persona.
*   **Editing:** You can return to the Gem manager to update instructions, rename, or delete a Gem. You can also copy a premade Gem to use as a template for your own version.
*   **Integrations:** You can use `@` mentions within a Gem chat to pull in data from extensions like **Google Flights**, **Maps**, **YouTube**, and **Google Workspace** (Docs, Drive, Gmail) if enabled.

### 4. Advanced Customization & Best Practices
Writing instructions for a Gem follows the same principles as advanced prompt engineering:
*   **Persona:** Explicitly state who the Gem is (e.g., *"You are a senior hiring manager at a top law firm"*).
*   **Task:** Define the primary function (e.g., *"Review resumes and suggest improvements"*).
*   **Context:** Provide background info. You can **upload files** (PDFs, Docs) directly to the Gem's knowledge base so it always references specific documents (e.g., your brand style guide).
*   **Format:** Specify the output style (e.g., *"Always answer in bullet points,"* *"Use a friendly, casual tone"*).

### 5. Requirements & Limitations
*   **Availability:** Currently limited to **Gemini Advanced**, **Gemini Business**, and **Gemini Enterprise** subscribers.
*   **Data:** To use Drive files as context, "Gemini Apps Activity" must be enabled.
